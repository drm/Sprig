Sprig is a syntax compatibility layer for the Twig template engine.

The primary goal of this project is to be a drop-in replacement for
Smarty whilst gaining all the advantages that Twig has to offer.

Here are the main features of Sprig:

- Built on top of Twig's robust engine
- Supports variable prefixing, e.g. $var
- Supports Smarty style syntax with {plugin param=$value}
- Supports Smarty style modifier parameters {$var|name:"Argument"}
- Supports all Smarty native tags (foreach, section, include, assign, 
  capture, etc)

Currently this project is under heavy development.Please contribute 
to this project by providing issue reports, usage documentation 
and/or unit tests for features or bugs.
