Sprig is the working title for a set of extensions to Twig, to make
Twig behave like Smarty.

The primary goal of this project is to make it easier to migrate 
from Smarty to Twig, in projects that are currently using Smarty.

Here are the main features of Sprig:

- Built on top of Twig's robust engine
- Supports variable prefixing
- Supports Smarty style syntax with {plugin param=value}
- Supports Smarty style modifier parameters {$var|name:"Argument"}
- Supports all Smarty native tags (foreach, section, include, assign, 
  capture, etc)

Currently this project is under heavy development and should not yet be
used except for testing the project itself.

Please contribute to this project by providing unit tests for wishlist 
features or bugs.
