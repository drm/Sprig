Sprig is the working title for a set of extensions to Twig, to make
Twig behave like Smarty, and add some nice features.

The primary goal of this project is not to degrade Twig to Smarty, but make it
easier to migrate from Smarty to Twig.

Secondary, Twig's conformance to the Django template language made it a language
that stands too far from PHP. PHP users are used to dollar signs before 
variables. So that part of Twig is patched in Smiggy as well.

Here are the main features of Smiggy:

- Built on top of Twig's robust engine
- Supports variable prefixing
- Supports Smarty style syntax with {plugin param=value}
- Supports Smarty style modifier parameters {$var|name:"Argument"}

Please contribute to this project by providing unit tests for wishlist 
features or bugs.
