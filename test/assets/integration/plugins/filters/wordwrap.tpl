    Urban fantasy as a subgenre usually has a little bit of hard-boiled noir action going on, blending fantasy with the elements of a modern crime story. Here's a body, in other words, or some other horrible atrocity, and now here's a hero/heroine with a special magical doodad/heritage who's going to avenge/solve the crime. That's the super-duper simple version, and the umbrella term can cover much more, of course but that should get you started.
